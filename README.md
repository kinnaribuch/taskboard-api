## Overview

  

TaskBoard is a web-based task management application designed to help users organize their projects through customizable boards, lists, and cards. It provides an intuitive drag-and-drop interface for users to manage their tasks effectively.

  

### Problem

  

I worked in a non-profit organization where we relied on a trial version of a task management app for managing projects. However, the free trial expired, disrupting our workflow and causing delays. This gave me the idea to build a task management app that is free and open-source, ensuring that non-profits and other organizations can continue their work without the constraints of trial periods or subscription fees.

  

### User Profile

  

-  **Project Managers**: To organize and oversee project tasks.

-  **Teams**: To collaborate and track the progress of shared projects.

-  **Individuals**: To manage personal tasks and stay organized.

  

Special considerations include:

  

-  **User-Friendliness**: A simple and intuitive interface for non-technical users.

-  **Collaboration**: Features to support teamwork, such as task assignment and commenting.

  

### Features

  

-  **User Sign Up & Login:** Users can sign up and log in to manage their tasks and projects.

-  **Create Boards**: Users can create multiple boards for different projects.

-  **Create Lists**: Within each board, users can create lists to categorize tasks.

-  **Create Cards**: Users can create task cards within lists, with details such as description, assignee, and due date.

-  **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Easily move cards between lists.

-  **Edit and Delete**: Users can edit and delete boards, lists, and cards.

-  **Assignee and Description Popups**: Users can assign tasks to individuals and add detailed descriptions to cards.
